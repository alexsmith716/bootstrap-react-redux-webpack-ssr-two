# bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-two


## Overview:

App is a continuation of repo 'bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-one'.


### To-Do:

  1) Implement `eslint`, `chai` && `jest`

### Babel:

https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages

### SCSS:

* Basic Guide:
* https://sass-lang.com/guide

* Built-in Functions:
* http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html

* Useful:
* https://gist.github.com/jareware/4738651


### PORTS:

  Server API (api/api.js):
    Port: 3030

  Server Static && init delegate `react-router` rendering (server.js):
    Port: 3000

  Server Dev (webpack-serve):
    Port: 3001


### Code-Splitting:

* utilizing 'dynamic import' format
* benefit: initial payload of app is smaller
* split points get loaded on demand
* entire app based on code splitting pattern via `react-loadable` library
* entire app based on splits (minus App.js, Home.js && NotFound.js)
* examples found in 'client/containers... Loadable.js' modules

* Regarding 'Loadable.js' modules:

* regarding utilization of optional 'webpackChunkName':
* allows the pulling of multiple split points into a single bundle
* split points with the same name will be grouped
* each split point generates a separate bundle
* allows for composition (load multiple resources in parallel)

* webpack wrapps emitted split point chunks in a `webpackJsonp` block

* initially app split points are router based
* feature based split points added later



### Webpack-Serve (references):

### Nodemon:

  https://github.com/remy/nodemon
  By default nodemon monitors the current working directory. 
  *** If you want to take control of that option, use the --watch option >>>> TO ADD SPECIFIC PATHS <<<<


### Webpack development server (webpack-hot-client):


#### Set options for webpack-hot-client:

* CLI: 'webpack-serve --hot-client --config webpack.config.client.development.js'


### Flow:

* A static type checker

* https://flow.org/en/docs/config/ignore/
* https://flow.org/en/docs/config/include/

* Flow needs to know which files to read and watch for changes. This set of files is determined by taking all `[include]` files and excluding all the `[ignore]` files.
* Including a directory recursively includes all the files under that directory.
* The project root directory (where your `.flowconfig` lives) is automatically included.
* Each line in the include section is a path to include. 
* These paths can be relative to the root directory or absolute, and support both single and double star wildcards.

* Ignores are processed AFTER includes. If you both include and ignore a file it will be ignored.

* Flow CLI: Using the command `flow` will type-check your current directory if the `.flowconfig` file is present. 


### Of Note:

* decorators make it possible to annotate and modify classes and properties at ru time
* a higher-order component (HOC aka 'enhancers') refers to a function that accepts a single React component and returns a new React component
* a component transforms props into UI, a HOC transforms a component into another component

* const EnhancedComponent = hoc(BaseComponent);
* import { Provider as ReduxProvider } from 'react-redux';
* const Provider = withContext(ReduxProvider);
