### Of Note:

/** react-bootstrap (Bootstrap 3 components built with React) https://react-bootstrap.github.io/
 * The `<Portal/>` component renders its children into a new "subtree" outside of current component hierarchy.
 * You can think of it as a declarative `appendChild()`, or jQuery's `$.fn.appendTo()`.
 * The children of `<Portal/>` component will be appended to the `container` specified.
